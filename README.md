# Discrete-Prime-Manifold-Resolution-A-Deterministic-Framework-for-Multi-Scale-Kinematics
This paper introduces a non-iterative alternative: Discrete Prime-Manifold (DPM) Resolution. By identifying a universal field tension constant (P=18.0), we demonstrate that celestial bodies occupy fixed coordinates within a deterministic geometric manifold.
